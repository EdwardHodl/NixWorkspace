Go to the GitHub repository at http://github.com/EdwardHodl/NixWorkspace. Navigate through all the directories, and read all the code. Write a readme for the project, making it short and sweet.
Include these headers: What the project does, Why the project is useful, How users can get started with the project, Where users can get help with your project, Who maintains and contributes to the project.
Include which software mechanisms are used, such as git submodules, nix, and nix-shell.
Put a warning note that the project is work in progress, and paths and user configuration are hardcoded at this time.
Output the readme in a markdown code block.
Be very succinct and don't repeat yourself. Be brief but to the point. Use point from where appropriate. Your tone should be professional, boring, but technical and encouraging.
Do not include any links in your summary. Only respond with the markdown code block.
