Generate a shell-script that puts manual documentation information into terminal when executing  nix-shell.
Include:  build instructions, executable paths, usage instructions for executables, configuration paths such as the data-dir, configuration instructions, clean-up instructions.
Also include anything else you feel pertinent to a developer.
Be very concise with your documentation, but use one-line ASCII text banners to isolate the documentation in the terminal.
Only include the shellHook portion of the configuration.
Include a reference to the project's source location.
Closely align your documentation to the project's documentation such as the readme, but be very concise:

Source location:
<SOURCE LOCATION>

Readme File:
<README FILE>
